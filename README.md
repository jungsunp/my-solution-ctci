*My own solutions to coding interview problems*

- Here I am uploading solutions to problems in Cracking the Coding Interview (6th Edition) in JavaScript. There are also solutions to interesting problems I found online/classes.

- From each .js file, I have included sample tests to check that the code is working as expected. To run the tests, just cd into the folder containing the .js file and run `node <fileName>.js` to run the tests.
